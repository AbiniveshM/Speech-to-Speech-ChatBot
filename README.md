This project is an interactive speech-to-speech AI chatbot built using Python and Streamlit. The application allows users to record their voice, converts it into text using AssemblyAI's speech recognition API, generates AI responses via GPT-2 (a state-of-the-art language model from OpenAI), and then converts the AI's response back into speech using Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS). The goal of the project is to demonstrate a seamless and real-time voice interaction between a user and an AI model.
